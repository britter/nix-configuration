- Adopt home manager and migrate dotfiles to it
  - tmux, and helix configuration (starship can probably be dropped)
  - configure gpg to trust my own keys? Check the git log with --show-signatures and it will say the key is not trusted.
  - java
  - Figure out whether more of Firefox configuration can be declared via nix
    - bookmarks from bookmark menu
    - disable Mozilla data collection
