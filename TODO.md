# TODO

- Split up home.nix
- Configure gpg to trust my own keys? Check the git log with --show-signatures and it will say the key is not trusted.
- Figure out whether more of Firefox configuration can be declared via nix
  - bookmarks from bookmark menu
  - disable Mozilla data collection
- Blackbox: Catpuccin theme, font settings OR use Alacitty instead of BlackBox because it has better home-manager support
- Manage 1password via home-manager
- Remove GNOME software I don't need
- Catpuccin theme all the way - including as GNOME Theme
