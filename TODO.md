# TODO

- Adopt home manager and migrate dotfiles to it
  - tmux, and helix configuration (starship can probably be dropped)
  - configure gpg to trust my own keys? Check the git log with --show-signatures and it will say the key is not trusted.
  - Figure out whether more of Firefox configuration can be declared via nix
    - bookmarks from bookmark menu
    - disable Mozilla data collection
  - Blackbox: Catpuccin theme, font settings
  - 1password
  - Remove GNOME software I don't need
- Configure nix-shell to spawn in fish shell
- Catpuccin theme all the way
- Learn about flakes
