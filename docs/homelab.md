# Homelab

## Manual setup

This section lists all the things I configured manually while setting up my homelab.
All of this configuration should be part of the backups, so it's only required to refer to when setting up one of the services from sratch.

### NextCloud

#### General

1. Configured users

#### Bookmarks app

1. Configured the bookmarks app for internet access so it can fetch previews.

#### Richdocuments app

1. Configure URL of Collabora Online Server to point to the server
2. Configure Allow list to only allow 172.17.0.2 (IP of the collabora docker container)
